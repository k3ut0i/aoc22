* DONE Day01
Simple reduction operation.
I need to figure out ponylang:
- [X] Input/Output
Output is simple enough ~env.out.print~.
Input is complicated. Why is it? What does /Stdin represented as an actor/ mean?
- [X] Iteration
for loops are simple enough

~a.pop() + a.pop() + a.pop()~ on an array of strings [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will not give me 543 but 345. ~+~ is a method and hence arguments are executed first. So the final ~a.pop~ is executed first. So I have to be careful when chaining expressions.

* DONE Day02
** Pony
- enumerations and type unions
- simple matching ~match~
- multiple constructors
- partial methods
** Logic
Mostly trivial hand coding.
